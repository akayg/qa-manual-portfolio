# QA Manual Portfolio 🧠

Welcome to my QA Manual Testing Portfolio! This repository highlights my hands‑on experience with manual testing, including test planning, test case design, bug reporting, and exploratory testing using real-world scenarios.

---

## 🛠 Project Overview

This portfolio demonstrates:

- **Test Planning & Test Cases**  
  Structured test plans and cases based on user stories and requirements for sample web/mobile apps.

- **Bug Reporting**  
  Real bug reports (with detailed steps, severity, screenshots/videos) created during exploratory testing.

- **Exploratory Testing Reports**  
  Session-based notes and exploratory tours across various apps to uncover edge cases.

- **Test Reports & Metrics**  
  A sample test summary report outlining executed cases, pass/fail rates, and defect counts.

- **API Testing (Postman collections)**  
  Basic REST API validation flows to confirm endpoints, status codes, and payloads are correct.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Manual test case design (functional, boundary, exploratory)
- Exploratory testing techniques and Session-Based Testing
- Structured bug report writing (steps, expected vs actual, severity, attachments)
- Test documentation with clear metrics and reporting formats
- Basic REST API testing using Postman
- Bug triage and defect tracking mindset

---

## 💡 Sample Projects Included

- **Web App Testing**: Login flows, user journeys, form submissions
- **Mobile App Testing**: Exploratory testing, UI/UX issues, device compatibility notes
- **API Testing**: GET/POST validation checks with request/response assertions

These highlight **problem discovery**, **communication precision**, and **attention to detail** — core QA competencies.

## 📈 Why This Portfolio Matters

Recruiters and QA leads often expect portfolios from developers, but for QA engineers, a thoughtfully curated case + report collection can act as a powerful skill showcase. Sharing real testing artifacts demonstrates your ability to:

- Plan and structure test work
- Report defects clearly and reproducibly
- Produce test coverage and summary metrics
- Learn key QA strategies (exploratory, API, session-based testing) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 🎓 What’s Next?

To expand this portfolio:

- Add **test plans with traceability matrices**
- Include **automated checks** (e.g., simple Selenium/Python or Robot Framework scripts)
- Write a **blog post or medium article** about lessons learned :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Include **metrics** like defect density or test execution rates

---

## ➕ Contributing & Feedback

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome! Feel free to:

- Add more bug reports or exploratory sessions
- Submit improvements to test case formats
- Share feedback directly via GitHub Issues or via email
